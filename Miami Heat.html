<h3> <p> Growing up, I have always been a fan of basketball. It was the first sport that I was able to understand and comprehend at a young age.<br>I started off very mediocore at basketball.
 I hadn't had any actual organized basketball experience until my 8th grade year.<br> It took a large amount of work, but the dedication had payed off.
In actuality,if I had not improved when I did, I would have likely quit the sport.<br>Playing the sport through highschool had strengthened my passion for the
sport as well.</p> </h3>
