<h2> My favorite team growing up has always been the Miami Heat.<br>
Primarily, my interest in the team originated from just liking the team logo. To this day I still <br>
believe the Heat organization has the coolest looking logo. Their logo is a basketball,<br>
engulfed in flames. Sadly, I have never seen the Heat play in Miami, but I plan to soon.<br>
